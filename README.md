# MetalRaytracing

Raytracing sample app writting in Swift using Metal's newest raytracing APIs. 
Runs on macOS

### Currently working on
[x] Multiple light types (arealight, spotlight, sun, etc.)
[ ] More advanced materials (starting with refraction)
[ ] Sorting of metal functions to reduce divergence of threads in shaders (not a a real performance bottleneck yet)
